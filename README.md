## My process

### Built with

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** - For responsive layouts
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Responsive design approach
- **Semantic HTML5** - Accessible markup
- **CSS custom properties** - For consistent theming

### What I learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice several key concepts:

**State Management with React Hooks:**

```jsx
const [cartItems, setCartItems] = useState([]);
const [itemQuantities, setItemQuantities] = useState({});
const [showOrderModal, setShowOrderModal] = useState(false);
```

**Component Architecture:**

- Created reusable components like `ProductCard`, `Cart`, and `AddToCartButton`
- Implemented proper prop drilling for state management
- Built a modal component for order confirmation

**Responsive Design:**

```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3
.flex-col lg:flex-row
```

**Tailwind CSS Integration:**

- Custom color palette using HSL values from the design system
- Responsive utilities for different screen sizes
- Custom font family configuration

**Interactive Features:**

- Quantity controls with increment/decrement functionality
- Cart item management (add, remove, update quantities)
- Modal implementation for order confirmation
- Hover and focus states for all interactive elements

### Continued development

Areas I'd like to focus on in future projects:

- **Advanced State Management**: Implement Redux or Zustand for more complex state
- **TypeScript**: Add type safety to React components
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Animation**: Add smooth transitions and micro-interactions
